## About me

My name is Miguel √Ångel, although on the internet I make myself known as Mikelangelo.
I am a student of Web Application Development and, as expected, the
computing and technology are two of my passions. It is fascinating to know all
the possibilities that programming has and all the things that can be created
with just one computer.

One of those things is this web page itself, created as homework for the subject of
Web Development in Server Environment.

I hope you enjoy browsing. All the best :)
